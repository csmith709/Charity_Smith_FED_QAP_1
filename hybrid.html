        <div class="infobox2"><h2>Understanding the Coyote Hybrid</h2>
            <p>Coyote wolf hybrids are similar in appearance to coyotes. However they do varry, with a larger and wider head and jaw. The ears are a coss, being more rounded that a coyote and pointier than a wolf's. There are found in similar coloring to both parents, though red and brown being more prominant than the white and wolf grey. They are oack animals and typically live in groups of 3 to 5. The hybrid is primarily nocturnal making it unlikely to spot during daylight hours. Their character is much more attune to their wolf nature meaning that they are more apt to roam.</p>
            <p>It is believed that hybrids prefer to live in the deepest part of the woods, however they seem to be just as content around towns. This makes them a threat to pets that spend time outdoors like cats and dogs.</p>
            <p>Little is known about the wolf population in Newfoundland. The native wolf species is long extinct, but the wolves belived to arrive from accross the ice are in unknown number. Currently the NL goverment does not officially recognize the presence of wolves or hybrids in the proveince despite the DNA evidence.</p>

        <div class="infobox3"><h2>The Future of Hybrids and Enviormental Impact</h2>
            <p>The much larger nature of the hybrid means that is far more adept at hunteing larger game like moose and caribou and there are some concerns to how this may affect the populations of those wild game. However due to their current presumed low population they pose little threat, but have potential to disrup the ecosystem.</p>
